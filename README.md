# Google-HashCode-Competition
Hash Code is a team programming competition, organized by Google, for students and professionals around the world. You pick your team and programming languages and we pick an engineering problem for you to solve. This year’s contest kicks off with an Online Qualification Round, where your team can compete from wherever you’d like, including from one of our Hash Code hubs. Top teams will then be invited to a Google office for the Final Round.
